\section*{Phase 1: Data Preparation}
This section describes how the training and testing datasets were constructed from the Daimler Pedestrian Dataset.

\section*{Phase 2: HOG Feature Extraction and SVM Training}
We extract Histogram of Oriented Gradients features and train a Linear SVM classifier.

\section*{Phase 3: Ablation Study}
Three ablation experiments are conducted to evaluate the influence of different HOG parameters.

\section*{Phase 4: GUI and Final Evaluation}
The trained model is applied to sample images and predictions are visualized in a GUI.
